    Terminal navigation:{

     5 Stages of pen testing:{
      1. Information gathering / reconnaissance <= legal
      2. Scanning <= openings in the target, operating systems.
      3. gaining access / exploitation <= stealing data, use data, change something
      4. maintaining access <= building back doors, root kits
      5. covering tracks
      }
_________________________________________________________________________________________      
     Information gathering:{
      #Active
        # find out as many things as we can.
        # talk to some one.
        # scan website
        # 
      #Passive
        # middle source <= use a 3rd party to gain info
          # IP ADDRESS
          # Employes data
          # tech busins has
          # website - what language used
          # posible vunerabileties
      }
______________________________________ 
      Obtaining IP Address, Physical Address Using Whois Tool:{
        # actively
          # In kali terminal & ping targeted website.
          Tools:
            # ping "website address" command <= IP ADDRESS
            # nslookup "website address" <= IP ADDRESS
            # use a website that sources out an IP ADDRESS
            # whois "website address" <= a lot of information 
              here that can be publicly accessed
            @"whatweb"
              # the default setting of aggresion level is 'stealthy'.
                Other levels of aggresion should be used only in 
                penetration operations.
              # whatweb --help <= a lot more info about possible uses of whatweb  
              syntx:
                # whatweb "url" <= basic info
                # whatweb "url" - v <= basic info but easy to read
                #
          # CTRL + c <= leave operation.
        # passive
          #
          #
        }
  }
