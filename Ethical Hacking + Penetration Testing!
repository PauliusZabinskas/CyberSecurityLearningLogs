  Terminal comands:{
    Terminal navigation:{
      # cd "drectory name" <= opens derectory mentioned
      # cd .. <= bring you back from child derectory
      # pwd <= print working derectory
      # ls <= list of derectories and files
      # 
    }
    File creation:{
      # nano "file name" <=
      # cat "file name" <= opens the content of file
      # python3 "fileName.py <= open python script
      # rm * -r <= delete all files and derectories
      # rm "file name" <= deletes a file
      # rm "folder name" -r <= deletes folder
      # touch "file name" <= creates empty file
      # echo "string " > "file name <= puts a string into a file.
      # mkdir "folder name" <= creates a folder
      # mv "file name" "folder name" <= moves file chosen to folder chosen
      # cp "file name" "full path to derectory / nameof file.py
      # cp "original file name" "copy name" <= copy a file
      #
    }
    Network commands:{
      # sudo ifconfig <= network info command. IP ADDRESS, MAC ADDRESS.
      # 
    }
     Root:{
      # sudo su <= access to root 
      # exit <= leave sudo su mode
      # remeber - can be created files that can be accessed / modifyed only via sudo su command mode

     5 Stages of pen testing:{
      1. Information gathering / reconnaissance <= legal
      2. Scanning <= openings in the target, operating systems.
      3. gaining access / exploitation <= stealing data, use data, change something
      4. maintaining access <= building back doors, root kits
      5. covering tracks
      }

     Information gathering:{
      #Active
        # find out as many things as we can.
        # talk to some one.
        # scan website
        # 
      #Passive
        # middle source <= use a 3rd party to gain info
          # IP ADDRESS
          # Employes data
          # tech busins has
          # website - what language used
          # posible vunerabileties
      }

      Obtaining IP Address, Physical Address Using Whois Tool:{
        # actively
          # In kali terminal & ping targeted website.
          Tools:
            # ping "website address" command <= IP ADDRESS
            # CTRL + c <= leave operation ping.
            # nslookup "website address" <= IP ADDRESS
            # use a website that sources out an IP ADDRESS
            # whois "website address" <= a lot of information 
              here that can be publicly accessed
            @"whatweb"
              # the default setting of aggresion level is 'stealthy'.
                Other levels of aggresion should be used only in 
                penetration operations.
              # whatweb --help <= a lot more info about possible uses of whatweb  
              syntx:
                # whatweb "url" <= basic info
                # whatweb "url" - v <= basic info but easy to read
                
              Information:
              # after running ifconfig command in eth0 section, inet xxx.xxx.x.x is
                IP ADDRESS. netmask 255.255.255.0 . 255 <= indicates that number can not change.
                0 <= indicates digit that can change.
           => # whatweb "range from-to" --aggression 3 -v <= syntax of scanning 
                multiple home IP ADDRESS'es at once.
                #example:
                1. whatweb xxx.xxx.xxx.0-xxx.xxx.xxx.255 --aggression 3 -v --no-errors
                2. whatweb xxx.xxx.xxx.0-xxx.xxx.xxx.255 --aggression 3 -v --no-errors
                   --log-verbose="file name" <= Get IP Addresses scan, save it in .txt file.

        To get emails:
          Tools:
            # theHarvester
            # hunter.io
            # information gathering tools github
            
           theHarvester syntax:
            # theHarvester -d "url" -b all <= looks for emails in all social domains
              'all' can be cahnged to a single domain like 'google'
              
           hunter.io
            # can use for free with an account.
            
           information gathering tools github:
            #git clone "url" <= take existing tool and use it.
